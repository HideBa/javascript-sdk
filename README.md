# Spatial ID JavaScript / TypeScript SDK

This is the reference implementation of the [Spatial ID Object Model Specification](https://github.com/spatial-id/spatial-object-model-specification/) for JavaScript or TypeScript consumers.

## Code Style Guide

* This library follows the convention of `[longitude, latitude]` (`[x, y]`) when used in an ordered list. However, using an ordered list is strongly discouraged and a labeled object should almost always be used instead.
* The abbreviations of `longitude` and `latitude` are `lng` and `lat`, respectively.
